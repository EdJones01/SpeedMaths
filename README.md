# Speed Maths

My first personal android project, Speed Maths. This is a game about practicing you basic arithmetic skills against the clock. Attempt to answer the questions as fast as possible to beat your previous high score.
# How to play
Once you press play, a timer will count down from 3. After this you will be presented with a screen with 3 main elements. From top to bottom you will find:
- The equation to solve
- A window for you to write your answer 
- A button for you to clear the window if you make a mistake. 

The equation will not change until you get the question right. Try and complete all of the questions as fast as possible.
> **Note:** This project uses Google’s “Digital ink recognition” API which is a part of their ML Kit to detect the numbers the user writes with their finger.
# Settings:
There are a multitude of things you can change in order to make equations to your specific desire. You can change:

- Which **math operators** are allowed e.g. allowing only addition and subtraction.
- **How many questions** there are in each round.
- The **range of numbers** that are in the equations e.g. allowing only the numbers 1-10.
- You can turn the **sound** for the game on and off.

> **Note:** Each high score is saved depending on the configuration specified e.g. If you set a high score with 10 questions and then do the same game but with 5 questions they will have different high scores.
